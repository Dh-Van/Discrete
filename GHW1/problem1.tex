How many subsets of a 100-element set have more than one element?

\textbf{Solution:} There are $\binom{100}{2}$ subsets of a 100-element set with two elements, since this counts unordered pairs of distinct elements. Similarly, there are $\binom{100}{3}$ subsets with three elements. Continuing in this way and using the sum rule (these cases are mutually exclusive), there are 
\[
\sum_{k=2}^{99}\binom{100}{k}
\]
subsets of a 100-element set that have more than one element.

\textbf{Fixing the error:}\\
A subset $B$ of a set $A$ is valid only if all elements of $B$ are also elements of $A$. Using this definition, note that a subset of a 100-element set can be the set itself. The above solution omitted the 100-element subset. To fix this, change the summation to 
\[
\sum_{k=2}^{100}\binom{100}{k},
\]
which now includes the full 100-element subset.
\textbf{Totally different approach:}\\
Think of the 100-element set $S$ as a bit string of length 100. Any subset of $S$ corresponds to a bit string where a $1$ means the element is included and a $0$ means it is not. Each position has two possibilities, so by the product rule there are $2^{100}$ subsets in total.

Now remove the subsets with exactly one element (there are 100 of them) and the empty subset (one of them). This leaves
\[
2^{100}-100-1=2^{100}-101
\]
subsets of a 100-element set that have more than one element.
